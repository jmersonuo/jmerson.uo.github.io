# Before you start #

In this tutorial you'll use our interactive Story Map Journal℠ Builder to author your journal entries, which we call sections. For each section you'll specify the web map, image, video or other web content that you want your Map Journal to display when your users reach that section, and how you want that content to be displayed.

For example, you might choose to display the same web map throughout your Map Journal, and have each section automatically zoom to a different area on that map. Or you may author your Map Journal so that it takes your users through multiple web maps, and associated images and videos, as they read through the sections. Lots of different combinations are possible.

You can use any ArcGIS Online web maps in your Map Journal: you can create new web maps, use your existing web maps, or use web maps that have been created and shared publicly by other users or organizations.

If you'll be creating one or more new web maps for use in your Map Journal, you can either create them in [ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/home/) Online before you start building your Map Journal, or you can create them on-the-go within the Map Journal Builder. From within the Builder, you can also edit web maps that you own. After you have created your Map Journal, you can continue to work on your maps to refine their content, symbology, and popups.

This tutorial doesn’t cover how to create web maps in ArcGIS Online, so we assume you know the basics. For help with authoring a web map, see Make your first map in the ArcGIS Online help.

## 1 ##

Start the [Story Map Journal Builder](https://uo-online.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?fromScratch). You can use a free, non-commercial ArcGIS public account or an ArcGIS subscription account. 

Alternatively, you can start in the ArcGIS Online website, open the web map you want to use in your Map Journal, or any one of the web maps if you intend to use several, share it as a web application, and then choose Story Map Journal from the application gallery. The Map Journal Builder will launch so you can configure the application.

In this tutorial we'll use the default Side Panel layout but the steps are the same for the Floating Panel layout.
