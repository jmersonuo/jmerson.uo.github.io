Adapted from [arcgis.com](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/map-journal/tutorial/)

---
The stepts to follow to begin creating your story map are to:

1. State the story goal
2. Pick a format (“App”) see handout
3. Add a title and some basic text
4. Add an image
5. Add a map in an immersive section
6. Edit the map
  a. Change the basemap
  b. Add data manually (add points from the novel)
  c. Search for data (something relevant to the novel)

## Before you start ##

In this tutorial you'll use our interactive Story Map Journal℠ Builder to author your journal entries, which we call sections. For each section you'll specify the web map, image, video or other web content that you want your Map Journal to display when your users reach that section, and how you want that content to be displayed.

For example, you might choose to display the same web map throughout your Map Journal, and have each section automatically zoom to a different area on that map. Or you may author your Map Journal so that it takes your users through multiple web maps, and associated images and videos, as they read through the sections. Lots of different combinations are possible.

You can use any ArcGIS Online web maps in your Map Journal: you can create new web maps, use your existing web maps, or use web maps that have been created and shared publicly by other users or organizations.

If you'll be creating one or more new web maps for use in your Map Journal, you can either create them in [ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/home/) Online before you start building your Map Journal, or you can create them on-the-go within the Map Journal Builder. From within the Builder, you can also edit web maps that you own. After you have created your Map Journal, you can continue to work on your maps to refine their content, symbology, and popups.

This tutorial doesn’t cover how to create web maps in ArcGIS Online, so we assume you know the basics. For help with authoring a web map, see Make your first map in the ArcGIS Online help.

## 1 ##
Start the [Story Map Journal Builder](https://uo-online.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?fromScratch). You can use a free, non-commercial ArcGIS public account or an ArcGIS subscription account. 

Alternatively, you can start in the ArcGIS Online website, open the web map you want to use in your Map Journal, or any one of the web maps if you intend to use several, share it as a web application, and then choose Story Map Journal from the application gallery. The Map Journal Builder will launch so you can configure the application.

In this tutorial we'll use the default Side Panel layout but the steps are the same for the Floating Panel layout.

The dialog will appear that lets you add the first entry, the "home section", into your Map Journal. The home section is the first section your users will see when they open your Map Journal, so it serves as the introduction.

In this dialog, you are first prompted for the content you want this section to show in the "main stage": the main area of the display to the right of the side panel. Choose between a Map, Image, Video or Web page.

If you want to use a web map, which is the default option, click the Map dropdown and either select the map you want to use or choose the option to create a new map. If you create a new map, the map editor window will appear. After you've selected or created a map, you will then be given the options, shown in the screenshot here, to customize how the map is displayed. You can choose to display a particular area of the map, turn layers on or off, display a particular feature's popup, or any combination of those. For example if you choose a custom location, the Builder will prompt you to interactively zoom to the area you want to use, and then you'll press a button to capture that extent. This lets you override the default extent of the web map.

Press Next.

The Add Home Section dialog will now prompt you to enter and format the content that will appear in the side panel for the home section. You can type directly into the built-in rich text editor. You can also paste text into the editor from word processing programs in which case the formatting is carried over into the editor. You can also embed graphics, images and videos in with the text. You can also define "story actions" in the section's text so that, for example, clicking a word automatically zooms the main stage's map to a particular location. (We'll show you how to set up these actions in step 8 below).

Press Add. Your completed home section will now appear in your Map Journal.

To save your work so far, press the Save button in the top right hand corner of the Builder.
