<h2 align="center"> Sound and Alt Text</h2>


For this first exercise, we will be adding sound to marker popups in a mapbox map
  - in a popup using an iframe to share a video via absolute link (on the web)
  - in a pupup to share a sound file via a reletive location (on your computer)
  - adding alt-text descriptions to images
  

  Here are some additional resources you can explore:
  - [W3Schools iframes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp){:target="_blank"} 
  - [W3Schools image alt attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp){:target="_blank"} 
  - [W3Schools audio tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp){:target="_blank"}

### I. Getting setup  

The story map template contains 
  - A story content file (config.js). This JSON-formatted text file includes story copy, location information, and settings to control how the map & story are displayed. This is what the storyteller edits.
  - A map story file (index.html). This HTML file reads information from the content file and dynamically builds out the story and map controls. This is what the reader sees.

1. From the course R Drive (R:\Class_Data\Activity6), save the following files to your R drive:
  - index.html
  - Sound file


	When you open the map, you should have a mapbox-outdoor style centered on Portland.
