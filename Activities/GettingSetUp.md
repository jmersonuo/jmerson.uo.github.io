A. **Connecting to content**

- Primarily use canvas for slides and materials
- 
- You can remote into the lab computers and save your work in the lab to your “R” Drive, this will be hepful if you want to do any geoprocessing using arcGIS.
- If working on a lab computer, do not save directly to it's desktop or C drive. Save to the R drive or your preferred clould storage.

- Should show up in File Explorer automatically as R:\Geog490_5\Student Data\[your name]
